# Global suppression rules apply to all sources
# These rules help filter out common noise patterns across multiple feeds

  # Example: Suppress test alerts
  # These are common across many alerting systems and are not real events
  - id: global_test_alerts
    kind: keyword  # Match type: keyword (substring), regex (regex pattern), exact (exact match)
    field: any  # Field to match: title, summary, raw_text, url, event_type, source_id, tier, any (all fields)
    pattern: "test alert"
    case_sensitive: false  # Case-insensitive matching
    note: "Common noise across multiple feeds"
    reason_code: "TEST_ALERT"  # Optional: Short code for reporting

  # Example: Suppress training exercises
  # Training exercises are not real alerts and can be noisy
  - id: global_training_notice
    kind: keyword
    field: any
    pattern: "training exercise"
    case_sensitive: false
    note: "Training exercises are not real alerts"
    reason_code: "TRAINING"

  # Uncomment and customize as needed:
  # - id: global_exclude_test_urls
  #   kind: regex
  #   field: url
  #   pattern: ".*test.*|.*example\\.com.*"
  #   case_sensitive: false
